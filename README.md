# CryptoAC

CryptoAC (*Cryptographic Access Control*) provides end-to-end protection of sensitive data--such as documents, files and messages--through **cryptographic enforcement of access control policies**.

CryptoAC is an open-source tool written in the (multiplatform) Kotlin language; it comes either with an easy **microservice-based** architecture including an optimisation step to maximise the performance and the security of the deployment or, potentially, even as a programming library or plugin. CryptoAC is highly modular, can be easily extended to fit the needs of new scenarios and its APIs allow for straightforward integration with other services.
