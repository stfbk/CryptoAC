# CryptoAC | Documentation | Cloud

*CryptoAC* protects data-at-rest when stored in the Cloud so that neither external attackers nor malicious insiders nor the Cloud service provider itself can access sensitive data. In this scenario, *CryptoAC* allows organisations and individuals to upload, share and collaborate over sensitive files and documents through the Cloud.

In detail, *CryptoAC* employs hybrid cryptography combining traditional asymmetric cryptography and digital certificates with symmetric cryptography for fast en/decryption. A single administrator can distribute *Read* and *Read-Write* permissions over files, while the integration with the [**Open Policy Agent**](../OPA/) provides an additional layer of security.

The documentation is still under writing; if you are interested in a real deployment or you are just curious and want to know more, feel free to contact the developers at **sberlato@fbk.eu**.
