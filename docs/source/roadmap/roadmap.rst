Roadmap

Below, we present the proposals for improving CryptoAC as a tool. These are not research topics, but enhancements to the implementation of CryptoAC:
* **Versioning** - allow versioning of files (i.e., without RM) in CryptoAC for data at-rest (i.e., in the Cloud);
* **Key Management** - handle the lifecycle of cryptographic keys (e.g., generation, storage);
* **Native Deployment** - allow CryptoAC to run natively (i.e., without the JVM);
* **Web Interface** - generic enhancements to the UI of CryptoAC;
* **Authentication** - of users (e.g., login with passwords, multi factor authentication and single sign on) but also among, e.g., CryptoAC, the DM, the MM and the RM (e.g., Keycloak);
* **Parallelism** - improving the ability of CryptoAC to serve multiple requests concurrently;
* **Testing** - generic enhancements of the testing suite of CryptoAC;
* **Misc** - solve TODOs in the code (400+).
